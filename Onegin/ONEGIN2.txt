Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
Of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
with this the hero of my tale:
but God, how deadly dull to sample
let others learn from his example!
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
There once I too strolled back and forth:
but I'm allergic to the North...1
and never played a shrewder trick.
but when past joking he fell sick,
where you were born as well, I think,
and bred upon the Neva's brink,
let me acquaint you on the nail
he really forced one to admire him --
my uncle high ideals inspire him
without preliminary feeler
the legatee of his relations --
Such were a young rake's meditations --
as horses whirled him through the dust.
by will of Zeus, the high and just,
when will the devil come for you?
sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away!
